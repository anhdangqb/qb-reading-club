# Takeaways: Decision Intelligence

> Source: Gartner Data & Analytics Summit 2022

## 1 - Decision modeling

> It is not perfect decision, but moving them in the right direction.

Example of one "simple" decision of accepting/rejecting product return request?

**Discussion**
1. Who is/are decision-maker(s)?
2. What are factors influencing the decision?
3. How to measure if it is a good decision?

**Takeaways**

> Think about decisions in a structured way.

1. Begin by identifying and modeling your most critical decision
2. Decompose each decision
3. See what analytical techniques (predictive, descriptive, etc.) we have or need to optimize these decisions

## 2 - Decision networks

**Discussion**: Have you ever in the situations that your analytics works served stakeholders with conflicting interests/priorities?

> Create the decision model catalog, to capture key decision metadata (context, interdependencies)

Three key elements of decision cataloging
- Real-world situation and events (data)
- Decision actors / stakeholders
- Connected decision graph (Decision network)

> Decision never comes alone. By seeing it as a network, we are able to model decisions in a more conscious way.

**Takeaways**
> Make your decision networks explicit to identify interdependencies for further optimize decision-making

1. Cataloging decisions is a good way (Data, stakeholder, decision network)
2. Understanding decision networks is business critical
   - Balance local incentives and enterprise/eco-system goals
   - Improve the entire journey
   - Stakeholder involvement
   - Resolve bottlenecks
   - Improve decision risk management
3. Don't ignore the complexity and seeing decision in silos. Embrace and optimize.


## 3 - Optimize decision: Support-Augmentation-Automation

**Discussion**: Human and machine enable and operate the decision network. How we should combine and balance the participation of human/machine?

> Do we really need to "data-driven" everything?

Decision are driven by different factors, and best when blended. Data is one element not the only one:

- **Rational**: data-driven
- **Collaborative**: mutual agree / voting
- **Principle** (rules)
- **Instinctive**: gut feeling, emotions, experiences

Human/Machine hybrid for decision-making:

- **Decision support**: Human decided what analysis/reports to use, use as information to make decisions
- **Decision augmentation**: Machine suggests, human decide to accept/reject (approve)
- **Decision automation**: Machine acts, human routinely review later

1. **Decision complexity**: elementary, structured (Auto) - dynamic, interconnected (Support)
2. **Decision timing**: second (Auto) - days (Support)
3. **Decision risk**: low (Auto) - high (Very high)

**Takeaways**

> Determine the right level of automation in decision-making by applying the key criteria of timing, complexity and risk.


## Recaps

1. Optimize decisions by composing decision intelligence solutions and map them with our toolbox of analytics techniques (predictive, prescriptive, etc.)
2. Create decision model catalog, capturing of key decision metadata (context, interdependencies)
3. Analyze the complexity of decision network (graph technology) to have the right level of automation
